I came across this interesting piece of art by Paul Brand at the Norwegian Museum of Contemporary Art in Oslo, Norway. Vials are evenly arranged on a circle, and each vial contains a different amount of blue liquid.

This is essentially a visualization of a periodic function $$f(\theta)$$ with a period of $$2\pi$$. The liquid level in each vial represents the function value at that particular polar coordinate, $$\theta$$.

Note the larger difference in liquid level between the top-most vial and the vial to the left of it. This suggests that the artist may have chosen a *discontinuous* $$2\pi$$-periodic function to visualize here. But, in reality, the behavior of the function is unknown between each vial with this visualization strategy.
